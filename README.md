 - Min-Gyu Kim & Matthew Bartos

# Abstract
 new model built specifically for watershed-scale simulation and management of HABs that integrates unsteady hydraulics, multi-constituent contaminant transport and reaction kinetics, and online multi-constituent DA capabilities via an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) approach.
